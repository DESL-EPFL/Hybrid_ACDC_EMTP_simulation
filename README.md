# Hybrid-AC-DC-EMTP-simulation

We provide an EMTP-RV model of a hybrid low-voltage AC/DC grid. The 18 node AC grid (identical to the CIGREE low-voltage distribution grid [1]) is coupled using 4 voltage source converters to an 8 node DC grid. Two simulations are provided: one model that includes a exact switching VSC model and one that uses a average VSC model. The simulations are used for the validation of a linear state estimation algorithm for hybrid AC/DC micro grids [2].
